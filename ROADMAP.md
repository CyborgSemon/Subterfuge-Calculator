# Subterfuge Calculator Roadmap

## Current Release

### 1.0 Initial Idea
* Come up with an initial idea and figure out how to lay out the calculator on a browser

## Future Releases

### 1.1 Finalise Website Design
* Finalise website design so it is ready to add javascript to handle the function of the calculator

### 1.2 Add / Remove Calculator Specialists
* Have the ability to add, change or remove specialists to the battle through a dialog of some kind instead of just having all of the possible specialists cluttering up the main screen
* **Side note** This should also keep the interface tidy on all devices
